  **Design Movement**: Neumorphism / Soft UI
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Comfort & Calm**: Soft shadows and rounded elements to create a soothing, non-threatening environment for users seeking medical information.
  2. **Clarity & Focus**: Minimal visual noise to ensure critical information (first aid, symptoms) is easily digestible.
  3. **Accessibility First**: High contrast text on soft backgrounds to ensure readability for all users, including those with visual sensitivities.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA) - Represents epilepsy awareness but in a calming, approachable way.
  - **Secondary**: Deep Purple (#4B0082) - For high-contrast text and key actions, grounding the design.
  - **Accent**: Teal (#008080) - Represents healing and balance, used sparingly for call-to-actions.
  - **Background**: Off-white / Light Gray (#F5F5F5) - Reduces eye strain compared to stark white.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Card-Based Flow**: Information is chunked into soft, elevated cards that float on the background.
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Content is balanced by visual weight rather than a strict grid, creating a more organic feel.
  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Shadows**: Elements appear to be extruded from the background rather than placed on top.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Generous border-radius (16px+) on all cards and buttons.
  - **Floating Action Button (FAB)**: A persistent "Get Help" button that floats in the corner.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Gentle Feedback**: Buttons press in softly when clicked; hover states are subtle lifts.
  - **Smooth Scrolling**: Navigation feels fluid and unhurried.
  **Animation**:
  - **Fade-ins**: Content gently fades in as the user scrolls.
  - **Pulse Effects**: Important alerts (like "Call 911") have a slow, calming pulse.
  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Nunito* (Rounded sans-serif) - Friendly and approachable.
  - **Body**: *Open Sans* - Highly readable and neutral.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Objective Clarity**: Information is presented with absolute precision and lack of ambiguity.
  2. **Grid Systems**: A strong, visible grid structure to organize complex medical data.
  3. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic, asymmetric layouts to create visual interest and guide the eye.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Electric Purple (#6A0DAD) - Bold and energetic, demanding attention for awareness.
  - **Secondary**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) - For maximum contrast and cleanliness.
  - **Accent**: Alert Red (#FF4500) - Used strictly for emergency information.
  - **Background**: Light Gray (#F0F0F0) - Provides a neutral canvas for the bold content.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Content is organized into strict modules, but arranged asymmetrically.
  - **Whitespace as Structure**: Large areas of whitespace are used to separate sections and emphasize key points.
  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Bold Typography**: Large, heavy headings that act as graphic elements.
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles and squares used for iconography and decoration.
  - **High Contrast Lines**: Thick dividers to separate content sections.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Direct & Snappy**: Interactions are instant and precise, with no lag or "mushiness."
  - **Hover Reveals**: Additional information is revealed on hover to keep the initial view clean.
  **Animation**:
  - **Slide-ins**: Content slides in from the sides along the grid lines.
  - **Staggered Reveals**: List items appear one by one with a sharp, rhythmic timing.
  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Helvetica Now* (or *Inter* Tight) - The epitome of Swiss neutrality and boldness.
  - **Body**: *Roboto* - Clean, geometric, and legible.

  **Design Movement**: Organic / Nature-Inspired Modernism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Human Connection**: Emphasizing the human stories and community aspect of epilepsy.
  2. **Flow & Continuity**: Visuals that flow into one another, representing the journey of living with epilepsy.
  3. **Warmth & Empathy**: A design that feels like a supportive hug rather than a clinical report.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Royal Purple (#7B2CBF) - A rich, warm purple that feels regal and supportive.
  - **Secondary**: Warm Beige (#F4E4D6) - Adds a human, skin-tone-adjacent warmth to the palette.
  - **Accent**: Sage Green (#81B29A) - Represents growth and stability.
  - **Background**: Cream / Off-White (#FFFCF2) - Softer than white, easier on the eyes.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Fluid Shapes**: Sections are divided by curved lines and organic shapes rather than straight edges.
  - **Overlapping Elements**: Images and text boxes slightly overlap to create depth and connection.
  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Organic Blobs**: Background shapes that morph slowly.
  - **Hand-Drawn Icons**: Custom iconography that feels sketched and personal.
  - **Texture**: Subtle paper or grain textures to reduce digital sterility.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluidity**: Transitions are liquid-like and continuous.
  - **Parallax**: Background elements move at different speeds to create a sense of depth and immersion.
  **Animation**:
  - **Morphing Shapes**: Background blobs slowly change shape.
  - **Fade & Float**: Elements float up gently as they enter the viewport.
  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Merriweather* (Serif) - Adds a touch of editorial warmth and authority.
  - **Body**: *Lato* - A humanist sans-serif that pairs well with the serif headings.
